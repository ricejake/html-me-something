  <h1> My Coding Journey</h1>
</header>
<body>
  <h1>Past</h1>
  <p>   I was originally an exercise science major, but as I wrapped up my associates degree for that, I began to realize it was not the path for me.
      Changing majors isn't nessicarily uncommon for college students, but I had no other direction.
      I spent months contemplating every which career path I might want to pursue.
      After constant indirection on what to do, I decided to meet with a career advisor at school.
      She helped me pinpoint areas of interest, and to my suprise engineering was by far my most compatable subject.
      I never really considered any sort of engineering path, and honestly did my best to avoid subjects dependent on math.
  </p>

  <p> I researched many engineering programs (i.e. Civil, mechanical, etc.), and they sounding interesting, but nothing really stuck out.
    One day while researching, I happened to stumble across software engineering, and I was immediately intrigued. 
    I began researching entailed and found it was based on coding.
    I had little no idea what coding was, and if my impressions of it from the matrix were correct, then it was far too advanced me.
    I decided to try my hand at it and found some intro coding resources online, and was an instant connection. Coding became the path for me.
</p>

<p> I transferred from my local community college, and began my computer science journey at SIUE. I enjoyed the classes far more than I anticipated.
  Everything from learning basic coding syntax to converting binary to hexadecimal form. As spring break was nearing there were all kinds of rumors going around.
  People are questioning if the semester will be cancled, or maybe we'd be switching to online classes. I was completely thrown why people were concerned about this.
  As we know now a little thing called Covid-19 shook the world and my university.
  After plenty of disfunction, they began transitioning to an online format. 
  Unfortunatly for myself I was dealing with quite a lot of stress outside of class, and with a global pandemic hitting the scene things became too overwhelming.
  My grades plummited, and I had to drop most my classes.
  After the semester, I was able to officially declare my major, and begin working with my new enginering departement advisor.
  Excited to rebound from the disatrous semester I had, I set up my appointment with my new advisor.
  Things didn't get much better. My advisor informed me that many of the credits that my transfer advisor had told me would be transferred over were no longer accepted.
  I was upset, but ready to assume some damage control I worked with my advisor to see what I would need to do to get my degree.
  My previous advisor had told me it would only take about two years to get my degree. My new advisor informed me that was by far no longer the case.
  I would essentially be starting from scratch, and I would need to retake many classes.
  Look at my program outline SIUE no longer accepted even the most basic of credits that would normally had been fine.
  I was irate, but I thanked my advisor for helping me, left the meeting, and immediately unenrolled.
</p>

<p> I was felt rather lost at this point, but was determined to find a path to becoming a developer.
   I tried out an online college for a hot minute, but found that less resourceful than SIUE.
   It was tough in the midst of a pandemic. There were very few bootcamps or programs availabble, and almost none would accept out of state residents.
   If they did they were expensive. I worked on coding and skills on my own, and tried to mimic SIUE curriculm as best as I could, but needed help.
   Then one fateful night as I was researching paths to become a developer I found an interesting program call LaunchCode, and luck would have it that it was located right where I live.
   I applied as soon as I could, and after a several weeks I got my acceptance in. This was an opportunity I couldn't wait to begin.
</p>

<h1>Present</h1>
<p>It is likely no suprise to anyone reading this I am currently in LaunchCode, and enjoying it quite a lot. It has been an enjoyable experience, and incredibly helpful.
   I have learned plenty about javaScript, and other basic coding tools. It's been fun interacting with other people intrested in development.
</p>

<h1>Future</h1>
<p>The future is always uncertain, but I feel like through LaunchCode there is plenty of promise. It's hard to truly have full sense of what goals I should strive for at this point.
  Currently I would have to say my goals would be 1) finish LaunchCode 101 2) complete LiftOff 3) start a career 4) join Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg as the next big tech giant who also dropped out of college.
  Well we'll see about the last one, but why not dream big!
